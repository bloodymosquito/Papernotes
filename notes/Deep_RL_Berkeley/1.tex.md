**Today**: What is deep RL, and why should we care?

## Deep Reinforcement Learning 

- *Deep learning* helps us handle *unstructured environments*: raw unstructured sensory signals, but not with *decision making*.

- *Reinforcement learning* provides a formalism for *behavior*.

==> **Deep RL**: use classical RL with deep models to solve complex problems end to end.

Atari classics: 

- Q-learning: Mnih, Silver, Graves, etc "[Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf)", 2013.
- Policy gradients:
	- Schulman, Levine, Jordan, Abbeel, "[Trust Region Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05477.pdf)" (TRPO), 2015.
	- Mnih, Mirza, Graves, Lillicrap, etc "[Asynchronous methods for deep reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf)", 2016.

## Learning from reward?
	
Where do rewards come from? Not always as obvious as in games. Problem of sparsity (cheetah hunting gazelle).

Other forms of supervision? Beyond learning from reward: 

- Learning from demonstrations:
	- Copy observed behavior
	- Infer reward function from observed behavior (inverse RL)
- Learning from observing the world:
	- Learning to predict 
	- Unsupervised learning
- Learning from other tasks:
	- Transfer learning
	- Meta-learning: learning to learn


## A single learning algorithm?

Biological example: surgery to map eyes to auditory cortex. Succeed to recover some visual acuity.

This single algorithm should: 

- Interpret rich sensory inputs (deep)
- Choose complex actions (rl)


## Deep RL today

What can deep learning & RL do well now?

- High proficiency in domains governed by simple, known rules 
- Learn simple skills with raw sensory input, given enough experience	
- Learn from imitating enough human-provided expert behavior

What has proven challenging so far?

- Humans can learn incredibly quickly
- Humans can reuse past knowledge
- Not clear what the reward function should be (and not clear how that works for biological intelligence)
- Not clear what the role of prediction should be
